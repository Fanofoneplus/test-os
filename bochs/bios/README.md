Please place all files from your <bochs' installation directory>/bios folder into this folder, so that bochs.config is able to refer to them.

If the names BIOS-bochs-latest and VGABIOS-lgpl-latest have changed, or if you want to refer to your installation directory instead, feel free to change romimage and vgaromimage in the bochs.config.
